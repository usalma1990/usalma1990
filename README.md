I am a graduate student at the Langara College specializing in Machine Learning and Data Science. 
I have experience in Web scraping, Data visualizations, Feature extraction, Dataset wrangling, Model experimentations, and Deep-Learning. 
I worked with both Classification and Regression datasets. 
I also have experience working with unstructured datasets such as texts and images. 
Some of the popular tools and packages I have worked with include - Scikit-Learn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, NLTK, spaCy, Gensim, Tensorflow, Keras, PostgreSQL, MySQL and Oracle Database.

Before my graduate studies, have experience working as a Quality Data Engineer, developing solutions for multiple clients. I have also Published an IEEE Paper entitled “Bidirectional Double boost DC-DC converter based on RCD Snubber”
